# Facial_Recognition_based_on_PCA

The folder contains all the source code for the application. The following are the instructions.

1) Establish the Database

Sequentially order the student's clear face photo with the filenames of 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc. into the root folder Database1 (Note: Each student must load 3 pictures).

2) Open GUI_cap.py and in the GUI press the start

3) Enter the student ID

4) Compile and run GUI.py, in the GUI press the start

Then you can have a look on the result. While for the process of capturing faces, you must need to use the clear and complete face without any cover. We suggest you to use the extract_face.py file to capture faces and then put them into the database folder.
